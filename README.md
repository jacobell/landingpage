# landingpage

This is the Landing Page project within the foundations course of The Odin Project. In this project I will use skills that I have learned including HTML and CSS to create a landing page from scratch.

Issues to resolve:
-Gallery wrap
-Gallery collisions
-Activate links at top
-Dead space below footer
